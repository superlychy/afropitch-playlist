## ⚠️ CRITICAL: ONE-TIME SETUP REQUIRED

You need to configure Edge Function secrets in Supabase. This takes **5 minutes**:

### **Step 1:** Go to Supabase Dashboard
https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/gildytqinnntmtvbagxm

### **Step 2:** Navigate to Edge Functions → Settings/Secrets

### **Step 3:** Add these 5 secrets

Copy the values from your `.env.local` file:

| Secret Name | Get Value From |
|------------|----------------|
| `ADMIN_WEBHOOK_URL` | `.env.local` → `ADMIN_WEBHOOK_URL` |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | `.env.local` → `RESEND_API_KEY` |
| `SUPABASE_URL` | `.env.local` → `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | `.env.local` → `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` |
| `SITE_URL` | `https://afropitchplay.best` |

### **Step 4:** Test Everything

1. **Test Contact Form:**
   - Go to `/contact` page
   - Submit a test message
   - Check your email (superlychy@gmail.com)
   - Check Discord channel

2. **Test Login Notification:**
   - Log out and log back in
   - Check Discord for login notification

3. **Test Submission Notification:**
   - Create a test submission
   - Check Discord for submission alert

## ⚡ SECONDARY SETUP: INCOMING EMAILS

To see incoming emails on your dashboard:

### **Step 1:** Go to Resend Dashboard
https://resend.com/webhooks

### **Step 2:** Add New Webhook
- **Endpoint URL:** `https://afropitchplay.best/api/events`
- **Events:** Select `email.received`

Now, when anyone emails your Resend address (e.g. `support@eihioclara.resend.app`), it will appear on your Admin Dashboard instantly!

## ✅ VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

After configuring Edge Function secrets:

- [ ] Contact form sends email to admin
- [ ] Contact form sends Discord notification
- [ ] Login triggers Discord notification
- [ ] New submission triggers Discord notification
- [ ] Withdrawal request triggers Discord notification
- [ ] System logs are being populated
- [ ] Online user count works

---

## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING

### If contact form still fails:
1. Check `.env.local` has `RESEND_API_KEY`
2. Check `.env.local` has `ADMIN_EMAIL`
3. Check `.env.local` has `ADMIN_WEBHOOK_URL`
4. Restart your dev server: `npm run dev`

### If Discord notifications don't work:
1. Verify Edge Function secrets are configured in Supabase
2. Check Edge Function logs: `npx supabase functions logs notify-admin`
3. Test webhook manually with curl

### If emails don't send:
1. Verify Resend API key is valid
2. Check Resend dashboard for delivery status
3. Verify sender domain is verified in Resend
